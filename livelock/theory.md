LIVELOCK

Livelocks are programs that are actively performing concurrent operations, but these operations
do nothing to move the state of the program forward.

Have you ever been in a hallway walking toward another person? She moves to one side to let
you pass, but you’ve just done the same. So you move to the other side, but she’s also done
the same. Imagine this going on forever, and you understand livelocks.
